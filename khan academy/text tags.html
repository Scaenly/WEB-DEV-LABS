        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. <em>Can’t talk, can’t walk</em>, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a <em>little bit stronger.</em><br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        <em>It’s not that you don’t get it.</em><br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong> Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <strong>basic ideas</strong> that <em>anyone, anywhere</em> can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
